## Types of Wireframes
- Low Fidelity
- High Fidelity

## Low-Fidelity Wireframes
- Low-fidelity (lo-fi) wireframes are basic, simplified sketches of a product’s layout. They use placeholders and simple shapes (e.g., boxes, lines) to show general structure and content placement without focusing on visuals or interactions.

## High-Fidelity Wireframes
- High-fidelity (hi-fi) wireframes are detailed and realistic representations of a product. They closely resemble the final design in terms of layout, UI components, and often visual design elements.

#  Wireframing Tools Overview

Wireframing is a critical part of the UI/UX design process that helps teams visualize the structure, layout, and flow of an application or website before actual development begins. Choosing the right tool can make a big difference in efficiency and collaboration.

> ✨ **Pro Tip**: Start with low-fidelity wireframes in Figma to explore layout ideas, then evolve them into high-fidelity prototypes without switching tools!

## Benefits of Wireframing in Software Development

Wireframing isn't just for designers — it's a crucial step in the **software development lifecycle (SDLC)** that improves communication, reduces ambiguity, and speeds up delivery.

###  1. Guides the Design and Development Process
Wireframes provide a **visual blueprint** of how the application will function, making it easier for designers, developers, and stakeholders to stay aligned.

> 🔹 *Example:* In a booking system, a wireframe of the **checkout page** helps developers understand exactly where to place form fields, pricing information, and payment buttons — reducing the chances of misinterpretation or rework.

###  2. Facilitates Team Communication
Wireframes serve as a **shared language** between technical and non-technical team members. They clarify what's being built and how the system is intended to behave.

> 🔹 *Example:* A low-fidelity wireframe created in Figma can be shared during sprint planning meetings to ensure developers, testers, and product owners are all on the same page about layout and functionality.

###  3. Saves Time and Resources
Catching design flaws or usability issues at the wireframing stage is **much cheaper and faster** than during coding or after deployment.

> 🔹 *Example:* If a user flow in the hotel search interface feels confusing during wireframe reviews, it can be adjusted instantly — long before any front-end development begins.

###  4. Supports Usability Testing and Feedback Loops
Wireframes (especially high-fidelity ones) can be used to **simulate user interactions**, enabling early testing of workflows before implementation.

> 🔹 *Example:* Stakeholders can walk through a booking flow prototype to provide feedback on layout and steps, improving the UX before it’s fully built.

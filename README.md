ALX Prodev Wireframing Concept

## Types of Wireframes
- Low Fidelity
- High Fidelity

## Low-Fidelity Wireframes
- Low-fidelity (lo-fi) wireframes are basic, simplified sketches of a product’s layout. They use placeholders and simple shapes (e.g., boxes, lines) to show general structure and content placement without focusing on visuals or interactions.

## High-Fidelity Wireframes
- High-fidelity (hi-fi) wireframes are detailed and realistic representations of a product. They closely resemble the final design in terms of layout, UI components, and often visual design elements.

#  Wireframing Tools Overview

Wireframing is a critical part of the UI/UX design process that helps teams visualize the structure, layout, and flow of an application or website before actual development begins. Choosing the right tool can make a big difference in efficiency and collaboration.
